# üìÅ LeetCode Practice - Arrays

Welcome to my LeetCode practice folder dedicated to arrays! This directory contains solutions to various array-related problems and outlines common problem-solving patterns to enhance your coding skills for technical interviews.

## üìö What is an Array?
An array is a collection of elements identified by index or key, allowing for efficient access and manipulation of data. Arrays can be single-dimensional or multi-dimensional.

## üìê Common Problem-Solving Patterns for Arrays:

### 1. **Two-Pointer Technique**
- **Description:** Utilize two pointers to traverse the array for problems like finding pairs or reversing sections.
- **Example Problems:** 
  - Two Sum
  - Container With Most Water

### 2. **Sliding Window**
- **Description:** Maintain a window that can expand or contract to solve problems involving contiguous subarrays.
- **Example Problems:**
  - Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
  - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

### 3. **Binary Search**
- **Description:** A search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array, reducing the time complexity to O(log n).
- **Example Problems:**
  - Search in Rotated Sorted Array
  - Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

### 4. **Dynamic Programming**
- **Description:** Break problems down into simpler subproblems and store the results to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Example Problems:**
  - Maximum Product Subarray
  - Minimum Path Sum

### 5. **Sorting and Searching**
- **Description:** Use various sorting algorithms to organize data and searching techniques to retrieve it efficiently.
- **Example Problems:**
  - Merge Intervals
  - Kth Largest Element in an Array

### 6. **Array Manipulation**
- **Description:** Involves adding, removing, or modifying elements within an array.
- **Example Problems:**
  - Rotate Array
  - Move Zeroes
### 7. **Prefix Sum**
- **Description:** Create a prefix sum array to allow for efficient range sum queries and cumulative sum calculations.
- **Example Problems:**
  - Range Sum Query: Immutable
  - Subarray Sum Equals K

This directory serves as a comprehensive resource for mastering array-based problems, helping you build a solid foundation for problem-solving in technical interviews.
