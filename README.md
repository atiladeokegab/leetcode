What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element (called a node) contains two parts:

Data: The value stored in the node.
Next Pointer: A reference to the next node in the sequence.
Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, and their size can dynamically change as nodes are added or removed. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion at arbitrary positions.

Types of Linked Lists:
Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node, and the last node points to None.
Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both its next and previous node.
Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.
