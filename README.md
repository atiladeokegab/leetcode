# üìÅ LeetCode Practice - Linked List and Beyond

Welcome to my LeetCode practice folder! This directory is a collection of my solutions to various problems, focusing on key data structures and algorithms to build strong problem-solving skills for technical interviews.

# LeetCode Practice Repository
## Setup

- This project is managed using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python environment management.  
- Each **algorithm** or **data structure** has its own directory.  
- Inside each directory, there are multiple **problem files** (one per LeetCode problem).  
- Each Python file contains:
  - The **LeetCode solution function**.
  - The **tests**, written directly in the same file (using either `assert` statements or a testing framework like `pytest`).
  - This will allow you to debug your code and this is great practice for real software engineering 

## Example Structure
## üìö Data Structures Covered:
- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Hash Maps / Hash Sets**
- **Trees** (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
- **Graphs** (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
- **Heaps / Priority Queues**
- **Tries**
- **Disjoint Set / Union-Find**


## üìê Algorithms Covered:
- **Sorting** (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort)
- **Searching** (Binary Search, Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- **Dynamic Programming** (Memoization, Tabulation)
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Recursion / Backtracking**
- **Graph Algorithms** (Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim)
- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Two-Pointer Techniques**
- **Sliding Window**

## When stuck:
## Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Learn the Basics**
   - Understand fundamental concepts.

2. **Look for Real-World Implementations**
   - Find examples of how these concepts are applied in real scenarios.

3. **Visualize with Pen and Paper**
   - Sketch diagrams or flowcharts to clarify your understanding.

4. **Implement from Scratch**
   - Write your own code to reinforce what you‚Äôve learned.

5. **Learn the Built-In Libraries**
   - Familiarize yourself with libraries and frameworks that can streamline your coding process.

6. **Solve Simple Problems**
   - Start with easier problems to build confidence and skill.

7. **Tackle Hard Problems**
   - Gradually challenge yourself with more complex problems to further your expertise.
This directory serves as a hands-on resource for mastering these essential concepts, with a particular focus on linked list implementations and problem-solving techniques.
