## What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element (called a node) contains two parts:

## Data: 
The value stored in the node.
## Next Pointer: 
A reference to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, and their size can dynamically change as nodes are added or removed. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion at arbitrary positions.

Types of Linked Lists:
## Singly Linked List:
Each node points to the next node, and the last node points to None.
## Doubly Linked List:
Each node points to both its next and previous node.
## Circular Linked List:
The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.
## üìö LeetCode Practice
To enhance my problem-solving skills, I follow the [Neetcode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) for tackling LeetCode problems. This resource provides a structured approach to learning data structures and algorithms, helping me to prepare for technical interviews and improve my coding proficiency.

## üìö Commomn Patterns
## Traversal:
Loop through the list to access or process each node. Use a pointer to traverse from the head to the end.
 Example: Printing all elements, summing values.
## Two Pointers:
Use two pointers (slow and fast) to solve problems like cycle detection, finding the middle element, or merging two lists.

Example: Floyd‚Äôs Tortoise and Hare for cycle detection.
Recursion: Solve problems recursively by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, typically by working with the current node and recursing on the next.

Example: Reversing a linked list.
Dummy Node: Use a dummy node to simplify operations like insertion or deletion, especially when dealing with edge cases (like an empty list).

Example: Inserting at the head or tail.
Merging: Merge two sorted linked lists by comparing nodes and adjusting pointers.

Example: Merging K sorted lists.
Splitting: Split a linked list into two or more parts based on specific criteria (like even/odd).

Example: Rearranging a list.
Cycle Detection: Identify if a linked list contains a cycle using the two-pointer technique (Floyd‚Äôs algorithm) or hash tables to store visited nodes.
