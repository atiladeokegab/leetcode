## What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure in which each element (called a node) contains two parts:

## Data: 
The value stored in the node.
## Next Pointer: 
A reference to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, and their size can dynamically change as nodes are added or removed. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion at arbitrary positions.

Types of Linked Lists:
## Singly Linked List:
Each node points to the next node, and the last node points to None.
## Doubly Linked List:
Each node points to both its next and previous node.
## Circular Linked List:
The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.
## 📚 LeetCode Practice
To enhance my problem-solving skills, I follow the [Neetcode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) for tackling LeetCode problems. This resource provides a structured approach to learning data structures and algorithms, helping me to prepare for technical interviews and improve my coding proficiency.

## 📚 Commomn Patterns
## Traversal:
Loop through the list to access or process each node. Use a pointer to traverse from the head to the end.
 Example: Printing all elements, summing values.
## Two Pointers:
Use two pointers (slow and fast) to solve problems like cycle detection, finding the middle element, or merging two lists.

Example: Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare for cycle detection.
Recursion: Solve problems recursively by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, typically by working with the current node and recursing on the next.

Example: Reversing a linked list.
Dummy Node: Use a dummy node to simplify operations like insertion or deletion, especially when dealing with edge cases (like an empty list).

Example: Inserting at the head or tail.
Merging: Merge two sorted linked lists by comparing nodes and adjusting pointers.

Example: Merging K sorted lists.
Splitting: Split a linked list into two or more parts based on specific criteria (like even/odd).

Example: Rearranging a list.
Cycle Detection: Identify if a linked list contains a cycle using the two-pointer technique (Floyd’s algorithm) or hash tables to store visited nodes.

## When stuck:
## Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Learn the Basics**
   - Understand fundamental concepts.

2. **Look for Real-World Implementations**
   - Find examples of how these concepts are applied in real scenarios.

3. **Visualize with Pen and Paper**
   - Sketch diagrams or flowcharts to clarify your understanding.

4. **Implement from Scratch**
   - Write your own code to reinforce what you’ve learned.

5. **Learn the Built-In Libraries**
   - Familiarize yourself with libraries and frameworks that can streamline your coding process.

6. **Solve Simple Problems**
   - Start with easier problems to build confidence and skill.

7. **Tackle Hard Problems**
   - Gradually challenge yourself with more complex problems to further your expertise.
